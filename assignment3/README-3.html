<h3>Image Crawler Fork-Join Pool App (Assignment 3)</h3>

<p>The purpose of this of assignment is to deepen your experience
using Java functional programming features together with Java
sequential streams and their integration with the Java fork-join
framework.  In particular, you'll use the Java fork-join framework and
Java sequential streams to obtain, transform, and store images in
parallel.  </p>

<p> Like the earlier assignments, the code you'll write here will have
GUI and will run as an Android app. Please use this GUI along with the
unit tests discussed below to help test and debug your solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul>

<li>Videos that present a detailed overview of the Java fork-join
framework are available in videos 12 thru 18 in one of my <A

Functionality</H4>

<P>The ImageCrawler app is packaged as a project using the latest
version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin and
Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the
purposes of Assignment 3, however, you only need to be aware of the
following directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/">imagecrawler/utils</A>
and <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/">imagecrawler/crawlers</A>,
which contain the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test">image-crawler/src/test</A>, which is a
set of unit tests that exercise the features you're implementing and
are used to evaluate whether you've correctly satisfied this
assignment's requirements.  </LI>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="app/src/androidTest/">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is an
Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically. </li>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The app's
minimum API is 29, so you'll need to select an emulator that uses an
API >= 29 (I recommend API 30). If you don't already have an Android
Emulator you can create one by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<p> In this part of the assignment you'll complete the implementation
of an image crawler class in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/ForkJoinCrawler.java">crawlers/ForkJoinCrawler.java</A>
file that obtains, transforms, and stores images.  This class uses the
Java fork-join framework to perform an "image crawl" starting from a
root Uri.  Depending on the parameters used to run the tests, images
from HTML page reachable from the root Uri are either downloaded from
a remote web server or read from the local file system and the results
are stored in locally in files on the Android computing device. </p>

All students must use Java lambda expressions, method references, and
sequential streams for their <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/ForkJoinCrawler.java">ForkJoinCrawler.java</A>
implementation.  In addition, all students must implement and use the
<A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/SynchronizedArray.java">SynchronizedArray</A>
class instead of the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/UnsynchronizedArray.java">UnsynchronizedArray<A/>
class. <P> </UL>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available at <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS5253/tree/master/assignment3/">this
link</a> in my GitHub account.  Now that you've setup your <a
href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

  <p> The unit tests in the <A
  HREF="image-crawler/src/test/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler">image-crawler/src/test</A>
  folder are provided to increase our confidence that your
  implementation is working as expected.  You'll need to learn how to
  use the Android Studio GUI to run the unit tests locally on your
  computer, as described <A
  HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>.
  As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
  absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to detect problems
  in your code. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> Assignment 3 is designed to give you experience programming
directly to the Java fork-join framework APIs using Java sequential
streams.  There are more "moving parts" in this assignment compared
with previous assignments since the Java parallel streams framework
hides these fork-join details from app developers.  Therefore, please
start the assignment soon and ask questions in class, office hours,
and on the discussion forums.  The app, image crawler skeletons, and
unit tests are extensive, though you don't need to understand them all
to complete your solution. </p>
